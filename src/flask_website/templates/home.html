    <h1>Order Tracking System</h1>
    <p>
        This project, developed during a summer training program, addresses inefficiencies in the order flow within the company by providing a streamlined solution for order management.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system enables users to add and track orders, with real-time updates on their status. Departments can easily manage order states, enhancing overall efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        An integrated API allows users to check order statuses without waiting for replies, making the process transparent and user-friendly. This is just the first feature, with more enhancements planned for the future.
