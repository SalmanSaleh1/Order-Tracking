# OrderSync

This project is a web application developed as part of a summer training program to address issues observed in the order flow within the company. The idea emerged from identifying inefficiencies in how orders were managed and tracked. This application serves as a suggested solution to streamline the order management process, making it easier to connect between departments, manage orders effectively, and inform customers about the status of their orders.

## Features

- **View Orders**: Display the latest orders with relevant details such as order number, name, description, department, and state.
- **Add Orders**: Easily add new orders to the system.
- **Edit Orders**: Modify existing orders as needed.
- **Delete Orders**: Remove orders from the system to maintain an accurate record.
- **Order History**: Access a history of completed orders with a view-only option to see order details.
- **API Integration**: Provides an API endpoint to check order statuses without the need for manual messaging or waiting for responses, enhancing customer experience.

## Future Enhancements

This application serves as the first feature in a broader vision for order management. Future ideas may include advanced analytics, automated notifications, improved user interfaces, user management, and enhanced security measures to further improve usability and functionality.
